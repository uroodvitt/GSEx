Technical:
----------
All third party libraries downgraded, now fully compatible with WOTLK:
	Exception:AceGUI-3.0-Selectable-Panel 
	Reason: Could not found compatible WOTLK library, but it uses Ace3 for 4.0.0, which is after 3.3.5.a; so far no errors shown!

Wow API functions introduced after wotlk were replaced with custom functions. espcially:
	GetSpecialization() 
	GetSpecializationInfo()
	GetSpecializationInfoByID

Many errors ocur due to retrieving class name/ spec name, if error occurs check if returned class/spec name contains spaces.
		(Might need to check BM hunter).



The original code tests for "heroic" and "mythic" as they are different from "raid" and "party", because I never played pve beyond this expansion, I am not sure if an instance can be heroic or mythic but is not a raid or a dungeon, so I don't know what kind of functionality the original code yields. 
Hence, it recognizes 5 modes only: pvp,raid,dungeon,party,default(openworld), and heroic raid.
To Do:
AceTimer (tweaks, and possibly combat fix?)
